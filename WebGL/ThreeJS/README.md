If you are curious about what ThreeJS it is or you want to be a full stack ThreeJS developer, and you are confidence with 
your high school english, then the course fit for you.

## How are the examples structured

```
| README.md -> Must read first <br>
| Example folders <br>
  | <br>
  | readme.md -> Lecture description, points and how to run <br>
  | src -> Source files (html, css, js) <br>
  | static -> Static images and files <br>
```

## Requirement

* GPU
* Windows 10 or above is recommended, but it should work fine on all OS system
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/zh-tw/download/) stable version
* npm stable version (should contain in NodeJS generally)

## Getting Start

Be sure to run [01-basic-scene](https://github.com/LuckyPigeon/CG-Journey/tree/master/WebGL/ThreeJS/01-basic-scene) and
[02-webpack](https://github.com/LuckyPigeon/CG-Journey/tree/master/WebGL/ThreeJS/02-webpack) first to test if your NodeJS,
npm and ThreeJS works well.

You can use `02-webapck` example as your base structure, I'll mention what to update from example to example and make sure
you don't have to `npm install` all the time and create lots of redundant `node_modules`.
